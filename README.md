# ARKit (with Swift) Project: Perform a Magic Trick

This app was tested on an iPhone 7 device running iOS 11.0.3

## Prerequisite

XCode Version 9.0.1 (9A1004)

## Instructions

- Run the app 
- Wait until a plane has been detected (this will be shown as a grey rectangle on the screen; I personally think it works the best when the camera is pointed at the floor)
- Tap on the plane to place a magic hat
- Tap the "Throw Ball" button to throw a ball
- Tap the "Magic!" button to vanish the balls inside the hat
